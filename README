Simple ViewGroup, extending from LinearLayout, that incorporates an expanding and collapsing animation (on a vertical axis). The layout contains an "action view" which can be clicked to toggle between the collapsed and extended state.

Check the activity_main.xml and MainActivity.java for a working example.
